*The Amazing Randy*

Recently on TV, I saw an amazing magician and escape artist. Both of
his feet were laced up in a straitjacket, and he was
suspended by a [Dona:Noun] 60 feet in the air over a busy
[Ron:Noun]. And he escaped! A man who can do that must be a real
[Phuong:Noun]. I saw a magician once who put a lion
in a jar and then waved his magic [Ratna:Noun] and
made it disappear. I saw another [Diane:Adjective] magician who sawed
a beautiful [Dona:Noun] in half right on the stage. If you practice hard,
there are several [Ron:Adjective] magic tricks you can learn to do. For
instance, you can learn how to take a glass of [Arun:Type of Liquid] and
turn it into [Gio:Type of Liquid]. Or you can wave a [Ratna:Adjective] 
wand in the air and make it turn into a red [Noun]. All you have
to do is memorize the secret magic word, "Cattywampus-Bumfuzzle"
